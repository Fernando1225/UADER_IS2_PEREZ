    This program is the property of the company IS2Â© 2022,2023. All rights reserved.


    This program extracts the API access key to use the services of a bank.
    It takes two arguments:
    - The path to the JSON file containing the access key and
    - the key to extract from the JSON file.
    The program uses the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one
    instance of the BankAPI class is created.
    The program also uses the argparse module to parse the command-line arguments
    and validate them before retrieving the access key.
    If the access key cannot be retrieved, the program prints an error message.
